    "The NHL (National Hockey League) is one of the most exciting sports league in North America. It's popularity has grown steadily throughout the past few years both in both local and international markets. Led by a group of talented, young and exciting player, the league's popularity has never been higher. As a result of the league's growth, it's revenues has also dramatically increased. One of each franchise's biggest challenges is assembling a team to compete for the Stanley Cup under a salary cap. Player evaluation and contract negotiations has become crucial task for the management teams. \n",
    "This project takes a look at some of the player stats that can potentially be key in determining a player's value. Using multi-variable linear regression, it takes a grand view into the world of sports economics.   \n"

    "The project shows the difficulty that sports franchises can face when evaluation the value of their most valuable asset, the players. Retaining the teams best players is a no-brainer. However, sports teams are relying more and more on analytics and data science to determine the most appropriate value for each player. Obviously, the project used a very simple model and the projections were mot very accurate but it gives a small glimpse of how complex the task can be. Note that this is only taking 1 seaons stats into consideration. Data should be taken from multiple season to have a larger data pool to create a more accurate model."
